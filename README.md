Final Project README file


Our data for this project came from the website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires which is a free repository for data tables.

There was no processing neccessary to make our data usable because it was already in a .csv format and had no strange values or columns.

Our main visual is a heat map where the darker the shade of red, the more forest fires in that sector. By clicking on a sector, the two subvisuals,
a scatterplot and a bar graph, will update with data sepcifically from that sector. The text below the main visual will also update with 
information on the coordinates of the sector and exactly how many forest fires happened there. The sector is also highlighted using a dark blue thus
using visual popout. The scatterplot plots wind vs. temperature and the bar graph shows what month the forest fires happened. A legend is located
below the main visual to help the user discern between colors and map values to colors.
